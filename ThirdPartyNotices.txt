It's intended to be used with the [`<CacheProvider/>`](https://emotion.sh/docs/cache-provider) component to override the default cache, which is created with sensible defaults for most applications.  ```javascript import createCache from '@emotion/cache'  export const myCache = createCache({   key: 'my-prefix-key',   stylisPlugins: [     /* your plugins here */   ] }) ```  ### Primary use cases  - Using emotion in embedded contexts such as an `<iframe/>`  - Setting a [nonce](#nonce-string) on any `<style/>` tag emotion creates for security purposes  - Using emotion with a developer defined `<style/>` tag  - Using emotion with custom Stylis plugins  ## Options  ### `nonce`  `string`  A nonce that will be set on each style tag that emotion inserts for [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).  ### `stylisPlugins`  `Function` | `Array<Function>`  A Stylis plugin or plugins that will be run by Stylis during preprocessing. [Read the Stylis docs to find out more](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js#plugins). This can be used for many purposes such as RTL.  ### `prefix`  `boolean` | `Function`, defaults to `true`  Allows changing Stylis's vendor prefixing settings. It can be a boolean or a function to dynamically set which properties are prefixed. [More information can be found in the Stylis docs](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js#vendor-prefixing).  ### `key`  `string`, defaults to `"css"`  The prefix before class names. It will also be set as the value of the `data-emotion` attribute on the style tags that emotion inserts and it's used in the attribute name that marks style elements in `renderStylesToString` and `renderStylesToNodeStream`. This is **required if using multiple emotion caches in the same app**.  ### `container`  `HTMLElement`  A DOM node that emotion will insert all of its style tags into. This is useful for inserting styles into iframes.

This is useful to identify different sheets.  #### speedy  This defines how rules are inserted. If it is true, rules will be inserted with [`insertRule`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet/insertRule) which is very fast but doesn't allow rules to be edited in DevTools. If it is false, rules will be inserted by appending text nodes to style elements which is much slower than insertRule but allows rules to be edited in DevTools. By default, speedy is enabled in production and disabled in development.  #### maxLength  This defines the number of rules that are inserted into each style tag. This generally shouldn't be modified.  ### Methods  #### insert  This method inserts a single rule into the document. It **must** be a single rule otherwise an error will be thrown in speedy mode which is enabled by default in production.  #### flush  This method will remove all style tags that were inserted into the document.  ### Example with all options  ```jsx import { StyleSheet } from '@emotion/sheet'  const container = document.createElement('div')  document.head.appendChild(container)  const sheet = new StyleSheet({   nonce: 'some-nonce',   key: 'some-key',   container,   maxLength: 20 })  sheet.insert('html { color: hotpink; }')  sheet.flush() ```  # Thanks  This StyleSheet is based on [glamor's StyleSheet](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) written by [Sunil Pai](https://github.com/threepointone). ❤️

 # @emotion/stylis  > A custom build of Stylis  `@emotion/stylis` is a version of [Stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js) that has been modified slightly to make it smaller. The only Stylis option that can be changed is `prefix`, the rest of the options are already set to the values shown below and cannot be changed. This package also only exports the constructer, so you have to do `new Stylis()` and use the result from that rather than directly calling `Stylis`. The result of that function also cannot be used to create a stylis instance unlike stylis.  ```js type Options = {   global: false,   preserve: false,   keyframe: false,   semicolon: true,   cascade: true,   compress: false,   prefix: boolean | ((key: string, value: string, context: number) => boolean) } ```  ```jsx import Stylis from '@emotion/stylis'  const stylis = new Stylis()  stylis('.css-hash', 'display:flex;') // .css-hash{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;} ```  ## Building this package  To build this package from a newer version of stylis, update the version of stylis that is installed as a devDependency and run `node build.js` in the directory of this package. This will read the source of stylis, transform it slightly, use the [Google Closure Compiler REST API](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_api) to minify it, format it with Prettier and then write it to `src/stylis.min.js`.  # Thanks  Stylis was written by [Sultan Tarimo](https://github.com/thysultan). ❤️

 # Slack Web API  [![build-ci](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/workflows/CI%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI+Build%22) <!-- TODO: per-flag badge https://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags#section-flag-badges-and-graphs --> [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/slackapi/node-slack-sdk) <!-- TODO: npm versions with scoped packages: https://github.com/rvagg/nodei.co/issues/24 -->  The `@slack/web-api` package contains a simple, convenient, and configurable HTTP client for making requests to Slack's [Web API](https://api.slack.com/web). Use it in your app to call any of the over 130 [methods](https://api.slack.com/methods), and let it handle formatting, queuing, retrying, pagination, and more.  ## Installation  ```shell $ npm install @slack/web-api ```  <!-- START: Remove before copying into the docs directory -->  ## Usage  These examples show the most common features of the `WebClient`. You'll find even more extensive [documentation on the package's website](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api).  <!-- END: Remove before copying into the docs directory -->  ---  ### Initialize the client  The package exports a `WebClient` class. All you need to do is instantiate it, and you're ready to go. You'll typically initialize it with a `token`, so that you don't have to provide the token each time you call a method. A token usually begins with `xoxb` or `xoxp`. You get them from each workspace an app is installed onto. The app configuration pages help you get your first token for your development workspace.  ```javascript const { WebClient } = require('@slack/web-api');  // Read a token from the environment variables const token = process.env.SLACK_TOKEN;  // Initialize const web = new WebClient(token); ```  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Initializing without a token</i></strong> </summary>  Alternatively, you can create a client without a token, and use it with multiple workspaces as long as you supply a `token` when you call a method.  ```javascript const { WebClient } = require('@slack/web-api');  // Initialize a single instance for the whole app const web = new WebClient();  // Find a token in storage (database) before making an API method call (async () => {   // Some fictitious database   const token = await db.findTokenByTeam(teamId, enterpriseId)    // Call the method   const result = web.auth.test({ token }); })(); ``` </details>  ---  ### Call a method  The client instance has a named method for each of the public methods in the Web API. The most popular one is called `chat.postMessage`, and it's used to send a message to a conversation. For every method, you pass arguments as properties of an options object. This helps with the readability of your code since every argument has a name. All named methods return a `Promise` which resolves with the response data or rejects with an error.  ```javascript // Given some known conversation ID (representing a public channel, private channel, DM or group DM) const conversationId = '...';  (async () => {    // Post a message to the channel, and await the result.   // Find more arguments and details of the response: https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage   const result = await web.chat.postMessage({     text: 'Hello world!',     channel: conversationId,   });    // The result contains an identifier for the message, `ts`.   console.log(`Successfully send message ${result.ts} in conversation ${conversationId}`); })(); ```  **Tip**: If you're using an editor that supports TypeScript, even if you're not using TypeScript to write your code, you'll get hints for all the arguments each method supports. This helps you save time by reducing the number of times you need to pop out to a webpage to check the reference. There's more information about [using TypeScript](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/typescript) with this package in the documentation website.  **Tip**: Use the [Block Kit Builder](https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder) for a playground where you can prototype your message's look and feel.  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Using a dynamic method name</i></strong> </summary>  If you want to provide the method name as a string so that you can decide which method to call dynamically or to call a method that might not be available in your version of the client, use the `WebClient.apiCall(methodName, [options])` method. The API method call above can also be written as follows:  ```javascript const conversationId = '...'; (async () => {    // Using apiCall() allows the app to call any method and to do it programmatically   const response = await web.apiCall('chat.postMessage', {     text: 'Hello world!',     channel: conversationId,   }); })(); ``` </details>  ---  ### Handle errors  Errors can happen for many reasons: maybe the token doesn't have the proper [scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) to call a method, maybe its been revoked by a user, or maybe you just used a bad argument. In these cases, the returned `Promise` will reject with an `Error`. You should catch the error and use the information it contains to decide how your app can proceed.  Each error contains a `code` property, which you can check against the `ErrorCode` export to understand the kind of error you're dealing with. For example, when Slack responds to your app with an error, that is an `ErrorCode.PlatformError`. These types of errors provide Slack's response body as the `data` property.  ```javascript // Import ErrorCode from the package const { WebClient, ErrorCode } = require('@slack/web-api');  (async () => {    try {     // This method call should fail because we're giving it a bogus user ID to lookup.     const response = await web.users.info({ user: '...' });   } catch (error) {     // Check the code property, and when its a PlatformError, log the whole response.     if (error.code === ErrorCode.PlatformError) {       console.log(error.data);     } else {       // Some other error, oh no!       console.log('Well, that was unexpected.');     }   } })(); ```  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>More error types</i></strong> </summary>  There are a few more types of errors that you might encounter, each with one of these `code`s:  * `ErrorCode.RequestError`: A request could not be sent. A common reason for this is that your network connection is   not available, or `api.slack.com` could not be reached. This error has an `original` property with more details.  * `ErrorCode.RateLimitedError`: The Web API cannot fulfill the API method call because your app has made too many   requests too quickly. This error has a `retryAfter` property with the number of seconds you should wait before trying   again. See [the documentation on rate limit handling](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api/#rate-limits) to   understand how the client will automatically deal with these problems for you.  * `ErrorCode.HTTPError`: The HTTP response contained an unfamiliar status code. The Web API only responds with `200`   (yes, even for errors) or `429` (rate limiting). If you receive this error, it's likely due to a problem with a proxy,   a custom TLS configuration, or a custom API URL. This error has the `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, `headers`, and   `body` properties containing more details. </details>  ---  ### Pagination  [Many of the Web API's methods](https://api.slack.com/docs/pagination#methods_supporting_cursor-based_pagination) return lists of objects, and are known to be **cursor-paginated**. The result of calling these methods will contain a part of the list, or a page, and also provide you with information on how to continue to the next page on a subsequent API call. Instead of calling many times manually, the `WebClient` can manage to get each page, allowing you to determine when to stop, and help you process the results.  The process of retrieving multiple pages from Slack's API can be described as **asynchronous iteration**, which means you're processing items in a collection, but getting each item is an asynchronous operation. Fortunately, JavaScript has this concept built-in, and in newer versions of the language there's a syntax to make it even simpler: [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of).  ```javascript (async () => {   let result;    // Async iteration is similar to a simple for loop.   // Use only the first two parameters to get an async iterator.   for await (const page of web.paginate('something.list', { name: 'value' })) {     // You can inspect each page, find your result, and stop the loop with a `break` statement     if (containsTheThing(page.something)) {       result = page.something.thing;       break;     }   } }); ```  The `for await...of` syntax is available in Node v10.0.0 and above. If you're using an older version of Node, see functional iteration below.  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Using functional iteration</i></strong> </summary>  The `.paginate()` method can accept up to two additional parameters. The third parameter, `stopFn`, is a function that is called once for each page of the result, and should return `true` when the app no longer needs to get another page. The fourth parameter is `reducerFn`, which is a function that gets called once for each page of the result, but can be used to aggregate a result. The value it returns is used to call it the next time as the `accumulator`. The first time it gets called, the `accumulator` is undefined.  ```javascript (async () => {    // The first two parameters are the method name and the options object.   const done = await web.paginate('something.list', { name: 'value' },     // The third is a function that receives each page and should return true when the next page isn't needed.     (page) => { /* ... */ },     // The fourth is a reducer function, similar to the callback parameter of Array.prototype.reduce().     // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce     // The accumulator is initialized to undefined.     (accumulator, page, index) => { /* ... */ },   ); }); ```  The returned value is a `Promise`, but what it resolves to depends on whether or not you include the fourth (optional) parameter. If you don't include it, the resolved value is always `undefined`. In this case, its used for control flow purposes (resuming the rest of your program), and the function in the third parameter is used to capture a result. If you do include the fourth parameter, then the resolved value is the value of the `accumulator`. This is a familiar pattern for people that use _functional programming_.  </details>  ---  ### Logging  The `WebClient` will log interesting information to the console by default. You can use the `logLevel` to decide how much information, or how interesting the information needs to be, in order for it to be output. There are a few possible log levels, which you can find in the `LogLevel` export. By default, the value is set to `LogLevel.INFO`. While you're in development, its sometimes helpful to set this to the most verbose: `LogLevel.DEBUG`.  ```javascript // Import LogLevel from the package const { WebClient, LogLevel } = require('@slack/web-api');  // Log level is one of the options you can set in the constructor const web = new WebClient(token, {   logLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG, }); ```  All the log levels, in order of most to least information, are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`.  <details> <summary markdown="span"> <strong><i>Sending log output somewhere besides the console</i></strong> </summary>  You can also choose to have logs sent to a custom logger using the `logger` option. A custom logger needs to implement specific methods (known as the `Logger` interface):  | Method       | Parameters        | Return type | |--------------|-------------------|-------------| | `setLevel()` | `level: LogLevel` | `void`      | | `setName()`  | `name: string`    | `void`      | | `debug()`    | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      | | `info()`     | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      | | `warn()`     | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      | | `error()`    | `...msgs: any[]`  | `void`      |  A very simple custom logger might ignore the name and level, and write all messages to a file.  ```javascript const { createWriteStream } = require('fs'); const logWritable = createWriteStream('/var/my_log_file'); // Not shown: close this stream  const web = new WebClient(token, {   // Creating a logger as a literal object. It's more likely that you'd create a class.   logger: {     debug(...msgs): { logWritable.write('debug: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     info(...msgs): { logWritable.write('info: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     warn(...msgs): { logWritable.write('warn: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     error(...msgs): { logWritable.write('error: ' + JSON.stringify(msgs)); },     setLevel(): { },     setName(): { },   }, }); ``` </details>  ---  ### Automatic retries  In production systems, you want your app to be resilient to short hiccups and temporary outages. Solving for this problem usually involves building a queuing system that handles retrying failed tasks. The `WebClient` comes with this queuing system out of the box, and it's on by default! The client will retry a failed API method call up to 10 times, spaced out over about 30 minutes. If the request doesn't succeed within that time, then the returned `Promise` will reject. You can observe each of the retries in your logs by [setting the log level to DEBUG](#logging). Try running the following code with your network disconnected, and then re-connect after you see a couple of log messages:  ```javascript const { WebClient, LogLevel } = require('@slack/web-api');  const web = new WebClient('bogus token');  (async () => {   await web.auth.test();    console.log('Done!'); })(); ```  Shortly after re-connecting your network, you should see the `Done!` message. Did you notice the program doesn't use a valid token? The client is doing something clever and helpful here. It knows the difference between an error such as not being able to reach `api.slack.com` and an error in the response from Slack about an invalid token. The former is something that can be resolved with a retry, so it was retried. The invalid token error means that the call isn't going to succeed until your app does something differently, so it stops attempting retries.  You might not think 10 reties in 30 minutes is a good policy for your app. No problem, you can set the `retryConfig` to one that works better for you. The `retryPolicies` export contains a few well known options, and you can always write your own.  ```javascript const { WebClient, retryPolicies } = require('@slack/web-api');  const web = new WebClient(token, {   retryConfig: retryPolicies.fiveRetriesInFiveMinutes, }); ```  Here are some other values that you might want to use for `retryConfig`:  | `retryConfig`                                  | Description                     | |------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------| | `retryPolicies.tenRetriesInAboutThirtyMinutes` | (default)                       | | `retryPolicies.fiveRetriesInFiveMinutes`       | Five attempts in five minutes   | | `retryPolicies.rapidRetryPolicy`               | Used to keep tests running fast | | `{ retries: 0 }`                               | No retries ([other options](https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry#retryoperationoptions)) |  **Note**: If an API call results in a rate limit being exceeded, you might still notice the client automatically retrying the API call. If you'd like to opt out of that behavior, set the `rejectRateLimitedCalls` option to `true`.  ---  ### More  The [documentation website](https://slack.dev/node-slack-sdk/web-api) has information about these additional features of the `WebClient`:  *  Upload a file with a `Buffer` or a `ReadableStream`. *  Using a custom agent for proxying *  Rate limit handling *  Request concurrency *  Custom TLS configuration *  Custom API URL *  Exchange an OAuth grant for a token  ---  ## Requirements  This package supports Node v8 LTS and higher. It's highly recommended to use [the latest LTS version of node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule), and the documentation is written using syntax and features from that version.  ## Getting Help  If you get stuck, we're here to help.

 # @unimodules/core  ## JavaScript installation  ```sh $ yarn add @unimodules/core  # or  $ npm install @unimodules/core --save ```  ## Installation  If you are using `react-native-unimodules`, this package will already be installed and configured!  ### iOS (Cocoapods)  If you're using Cocoapods, add the following dependency to your `Podfile`:  `pod 'UMCore', path: '../node_modules/@unimodules/core/ios'`  and run `npx pod-install`.  ### Android  1.  Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:     ```gradle     include ':unimodules-core'     project(':unimodules-core').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@unimodules/core/android')     ``` 2.  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:     ```gradle     compile project(':unimodules-core')     ``` 3.  If you're using ProGuard, you'll need to append these lines to your ProGuard rules file for it not to strip out methods required for Expo modules to work.     ```pro     -keepclassmembers class * {       @org.unimodules.interfaces.ExpoProp *;     }     -keepclassmembers class * {       @org.unimodules.interfaces.ExpoMethod *;     }     ```  ## Usage  ### Glossary  - **Native code** — iOS/Android native code. - **Client code** — code _over the bridge_, for React Native it's the JavaScript app. - **Internal module** — a class implementing `UMInternalModule`/`org.unimodules.interfaces.InternalModule` interface. Its instance can be exposed internally to other modules via *Module Registry* (how dependants reference modules differs between platforms). - **Module interface** — an interface that should be implemented by the dependency so it can act as an implementation of it.      On Android modules implement an external interface (`expo-file-system` package implements interface provided by `expo-file-system-interface`). Dependants may access the implementations by calling     ```java     public <T> T getModule(Class<T> interfaceClass);     ```     method on the module registry.      On iOS its the consumer who defines required protocol. Implementations are identified by a protocol. Dependants access the implementation by calling     ```objc     - (id)getModuleImplementingProtocol:(Protocol *)protocol;     ```     method on the module registry. - **Module Registry** — well, a registry of modules. Instance of this class is used to fetch another internal or exported module. - **Exported methods** — a subset of instance methods of a given module that should get exposed to client code by specific platform adapter. - **Exported module** — a subclass of `{UM,org.unimodules.}ExportedModule`. Its methods annotated with `org.unimodules.ExpoMethod`/`UM_EXPORT_METHOD_AS` are exported to client code. - **View manager** — a class capable of providing platform adapter with custom views.  ### Registering modules in the registry  #### iOS  1. Open the header file for your module. 2. Import `<UMCore/UMInternalModule.h>`. 3. Add `UMModule` to a list of implemented interfaces by the module instances (eg. `NSObject <UMInternalModule>`).  4. Open the implementation file for your module and implement methods required by the protocol. 5. Use `UM_REGISTER_MODULE();` macro to register the module. 6. That's it!  #### Android  1. Add `org.unimodules.interfaces.InternalModule` to your class's imports. 2. Make your module class implement `InternalModule` interface.     1. Implement `public List<Class> getExportedInterfaces();`. Return a list of module interfaces implemented by the class, for example:         ```java         return Collections.singletonList((Class) org.unimodules.interfaces.filesystem.FileSystem.class);         ``` 3. Create a `Package` class for your module, unless you already have one.     1. A `Package` class should implement `org.unimodules.Package` interface (a `BasePackage` class is provided for you not to have to implement all the initialization flavors at once).     2. Add the `Package` to a `List` provided to `ModuleRegistryBuilder`.         ```java         new ModuleRegistryBuilder(           Arrays.<Package>asList(             new FileSystemPackage()           )         )         ``` 4. Add your module to be returned by `List<InternalModule> createInternalModules(Context context);`. 5. You're good to go!  ### Exporting module to client code  #### iOS  When registering your module for export to client code, you must first decide whether the class will only be exported to client code or will it be both internal and exported module. If the former is applicable, you easily just subclass `UMExportedModule` and use macro `UM_EXPORT_MODULE(clientCodeName)` to provide a name under which it should be exported. If your module should be both internal and exported module, you also have to subclass `UMExportedModule`, but this time use `UM_REGISTER_MODULE()` in the implementation and then manually override methods `exportedInterfaces` and `exportedModuleName`.  #### Android  Subclass `org.unimodules.ExportedModule` and add your module to a list returned by `Package` in `createExportedModules()`.  ### Exporting methods and calling exported methods  #### iOS  Use `UM_EXPORT_METHOD_AS(exportedName, definition)` macro to export given method to client code. Note that for the module to be available in the client code you have to provide a non-empty client code name in `UM_EXPORT_MODULE(clientCodeName)` or `- (const NSString *)exportedModuleName`. For now, arguments have to use basic, object types, like `NSString *`, `NSDictionary *`, `NSNumber *`. Methods are required to receive `UMPromiseResolveBlock` and `UMPromiseRejectBlock` as two last arguments.  #### Android  Given that your module subclasses `org.unimodules.ExportedModule` and it is returned by the respective `Package`, you just have to annotate the given method with `@ExpoMethod` annotation. Methods are required to receive `org.unimodules.Promise` as the last argument.  ### Exporting constants to client code  #### iOS  Implement `- (NSDictionary *)constantsToExport` method to export constants to client code.  #### Android  Override `public Map<String, Object> getConstants();` method to export constants to client code.  ### Creating a custom view manager  #### iOS  Subclass `UMViewManager` and override at least `- (UIView *)view` and `- (NSString *)viewName`. Register it with `UM_REGISTER_MODULE()`.  Use `UM_VIEW_PROPERTY(propName, propClass, viewClass)` to define custom view properties.  #### Android  TODO: ViewManager from interface to a class  Implement `org.unimodules.interfaces.ViewManager` in your class and respond with its instance in `List<ViewManager> createViewManagers(Context context);` in corresponding `Package`.  Annotate prop setter methods with `@ExpoProp(name = <name>)` to define custom view properties.

 # @unimodules/react-native-adapter  A React Native adapter for Expo Universal Modules. It requires [`@unimodules/core`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/@unimodules/core) to be installed and linked.  ## JavaScript installation  ```sh $ yarn add @unimodules/react-native-adapter  # or  $ npm install @unimodules/react-native-adapter --save ```  ## Installation  If you are using `react-native-unimodules`, this package will already be installed and configured!  ### iOS (Cocoapods)  If you're using Cocoapods, add the dependency to your `Podfile`:  `pod 'UMReactNativeAdapter', path: '../node_modules/@unimodules/react-native-adapter/ios', inhibit_warnings: true`  and run `npx pod-install`.  ### Android  1.  Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:     ```gradle     include ':unimodules-react-native-adapter'     project(':unimodules-react-native-adapter').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@unimodules/react-native-adapter/android')     ``` 2.  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:     ```gradle     compile project(':unimodules-react-native-adapter')     ```  ## Additional required setup  #### iOS  1. Open the `AppDelegate.m` of your application. 2. Import `<UMCore/UMModuleRegistry.h>`, `<UMReactNativeAdapter/UMNativeModulesProxy.h>` and `<UMReactNativeAdapter/UMModuleRegistryAdapter.h>`. 3. Make `AppDelegate` implement `RCTBridgeDelegate` protocol (`@interface AppDelegate () <RCTBridgeDelegate>`). 4. Add a new instance variable to your `AppDelegate`:     ```objc    @interface AppDelegate () <RCTBridgeDelegate>     // add this line    @property (nonatomic, strong) UMModuleRegistryAdapter *moduleRegistryAdapter;     @end    ```  5. In `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` add the following at the top of the implementation:    ```objc    self.moduleRegistryAdapter = [[UMModuleRegistryAdapter alloc] initWithModuleRegistryProvider:[[UMModuleRegistryProvider alloc] init]];    ``` 6. Add two methods to the `AppDelegate`'s implementation:     ```objc    - (NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *)extraModulesForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge    {        NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *extraModules = [_moduleRegistryAdapter extraModulesForBridge:bridge];        // If you'd like to export some custom RCTBridgeModules that are not Expo modules, add them here!        return extraModules;    }     - (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge {        return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index" fallbackResource:nil];    }    ```  7. When initializing `RCTBridge`, make the `AppDelegate` a delegate of the bridge:    ```objc    RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions];    ```     or, if you use `react-native-navigation`, add the `bridgeManagerDelegate` parameter of `self`, like:    ```diff    -[ReactNativeNavigation bootstrap:jsCodeLocation launchOptions:launchOptions];    +[ReactNativeNavigation bootstrap:jsCodeLocation launchOptions:launchOptions bridgeManagerDelegate:self];    ``` 8. That's it! All in all, your `AppDelegate.m` should look similar to:     <details>        <summary>Click to expand</summary>        <p>     ```objc    #import "AppDelegate.h"     #import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>    #import <React/RCTRootView.h>     #import <UMCore/UMModuleRegistry.h>    #import <UMReactNativeAdapter/UMNativeModulesProxy.h>    #import <UMReactNativeAdapter/UMModuleRegistryAdapter.h>     @interface AppDelegate () <RCTBridgeDelegate>     @property (nonatomic, strong) UMModuleRegistryAdapter *moduleRegistryAdapter;     @end     @implementation AppDelegate     - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions    {        self.moduleRegistryAdapter = [[UMModuleRegistryAdapter alloc] initWithModuleRegistryProvider:[[UMModuleRegistryProvider alloc] init]];        RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self launchOptions:launchOptions];        RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBridge:bridge moduleName:@"YOUR_MODULE_NAME" initialProperties:nil];        rootView.backgroundColor = [[UIColor alloc] initWithRed:1.0f green:1.0f blue:1.0f alpha:1];         self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];        UIViewController *rootViewController = [UIViewController new];        rootViewController.view = rootView;        self.window.rootViewController = rootViewController;        [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];        return YES;    }     - (NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *)extraModulesForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge    {        NSArray<id<RCTBridgeModule>> *extraModules = [_moduleRegistryAdapter extraModulesForBridge:bridge];        // If you'd like to export some custom RCTBridgeModules that are not universal modules, add them here!        return extraModules;    }     - (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge {        return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index" fallbackResource:nil];    }     @end    ```     </details>  #### Android  1. Open the `MainApplication.java` of your application. 2. Add to the imports:    ```java    import org.unimodules.adapters.react.ModuleRegistryAdapter;    import org.unimodules.adapters.react.ReactAdapterPackage;    import org.unimodules.adapters.react.ReactModuleRegistryProvider;    import org.unimodules.core.interfaces.Package;    ``` 3. Create an instance variable on the `Application`:    ```java    private final ReactModuleRegistryProvider mModuleRegistryProvider = new ReactModuleRegistryProvider(Arrays.<Package>asList(        new ReactAdapterPackage()        // more packages, like        // new CameraPackage(), if you use expo-camera        // etc.    ), /* singletonModules */ null);    ``` 4. Add `new ModuleRegistryAdapter(mModuleRegistryProvider)` to the list returned by `protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages()`. 5. You're good to go!  ## Usage  ### Calling methods on native modules  Native modules are available behind the proxy (`NativeModulesProxy` of `@unimodules/core`).  To call an exported method, use `NativeModulesProxy[clientCodeName].exportedMethod(...arguments)`, like this:  ```js // For UM_REGISTER_MODULE(FileSystem,) or UM_REGISTER_UMPORTED_MODULE(FileSystem) // and UM_EXPORT_METHOD_AS(getInfo, getInfo:(NSString *)path)  // or for method // @ExpoMethod // public void getInfo(String path, Promise promise) // defined in native module with name FileSystem  import { NativeModulesProxy } from '@unimodules/core';  const { FileSystem } = NativeModulesProxy;  FileSystem.getInfo('file:///...'); ```  Note that all the methods return `Promise`s.  ### Synthetic Platform Events  When creating web universal modules, you may find that you need to send events back to the API layer. In this case you will want to use the shared `SyntheticPlatformEmitter` instance from `@unimodules/core`. The shared emitter emit events to `react-native`'s `NativeEventEmitter` and `@unimodules/core`'s `EventEmitter` .  `ExponentGyroscope.web.ts`  ```js // Example from expo-sensors native web gyroscope sensor  import { SyntheticPlatformEmitter } from '@unimodules/core';  SyntheticPlatformEmitter.emit('gyroscopeDidUpdate', { x, y, z }); ```  This emitted event is then received with a `EventEmitter` in the developer-facing API.  ```js import { EventEmitter } from '@unimodules/core';  import ExponentGyroscope from './ExponentGyroscope';  const nativeEmitter = new EventEmitter(ExponentGyroscope);  // On Android and iOS, `nativeEmitter` receives events sent from Objective-C and Java. On web, it // receives events from the shared `SyntheticPlatformEmitter` instance. nativeEmitter.addListener('gyroscopeDidUpdate', ({ x, y, z }) => {}); ```

 agent-base ========== ### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base)  This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.  #### Some subclasses:  Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`. Send a pull request to list yours!   * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install agent-base ```   Example -------  Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):  ```js var net = require('net'); var tls = require('tls'); var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var agent = require('agent-base');  var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);  // This is the important part! parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {   var socket;   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {     socket = tls.connect(opts);   } else {     socket = net.connect(opts);   }   return socket; });  // Everything else works just like normal... http.get(parsed, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:  ```js agent(async function (req, opts) {   await sleep(1000);   // etc… }); ```  Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility for that HTTP request to that agent:  ```js agent(function (req, opts) {   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent; }); ```   API ---  ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]  Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback` for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.  The `options` object accepts the following properties:    * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).  The callback function should have the following signature:  ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined  The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will continue to proceed.  If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

 agent-base ========== ### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.  #### Some subclasses:  Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`. Send a pull request to list yours!   * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install agent-base ```   Example -------  Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):  ```js var net = require('net'); var tls = require('tls'); var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var agent = require('agent-base');  var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);  // This is the important part! parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {   var socket;   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {     socket = tls.connect(opts);   } else {     socket = net.connect(opts);   }   return socket; });  // Everything else works just like normal... http.get(parsed, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:  ```js agent(async function (req, opts) {   await sleep(1000);   // etc… }); ```  Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility for that HTTP request to that agent:  ```js agent(function (req, opts) {   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent; }); ```   API ---  ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]  Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback` for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.  The `options` object accepts the following properties:    * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).  The callback function should have the following signature:  ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined  The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will continue to proceed.  If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

Support `http` and `https`.  ## What's different from original `http.Agent`?  - `keepAlive=true` by default - Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)` - Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue. - Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.  ## Install  ```bash $ npm install agentkeepalive --save ```  ## new Agent([options])  * `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.   Can have the following fields:   * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by     other requests in the future. Default = `true`.   * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay     for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.     Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.   * `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout     after `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.     Default is `15000`.     Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.   * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout     after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.     Default is `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout * 2`.   * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per     host. Default = `Infinity`.   * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets (per host) to leave open     in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.     Default = `256`.   * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.     If not setted the behaviour continues the same (the socket will be released only when free)     Default = `null`.  ## Usage  ```js const http = require('http'); const Agent = require('agentkeepalive');  const keepaliveAgent = new Agent({   maxSockets: 100,   maxFreeSockets: 10,   timeout: 60000,   freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds });  const options = {   host: 'cnodejs.org',   port: 80,   path: '/',   method: 'GET',   agent: keepaliveAgent, };  const req = http.request(options, res => {   console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);   console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));   res.setEncoding('utf8');   res.on('data', function (chunk) {     console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);   }); }); req.on('error', e => {   console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message); }); req.end();  setTimeout(() => {   if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {     console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());   } }, 2000);  ```  ### `getter agent.statusChanged`  counters have change or not after last checkpoint.  ### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`  `agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:  ```js {   createSocketCount: 10,   closeSocketCount: 5,   timeoutSocketCount: 0,   requestCount: 5,   freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },   sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },   requests: {} } ```  ### Support `https`  ```js const https = require('https'); const HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;  const keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent(); // https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 const options = {   host: 'www.google.com',   port: 443,   path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',   method: 'GET',   agent: keepaliveAgent, };  const req = https.request(options, res => {   console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);   console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));   res.setEncoding('utf8');   res.on('data', chunk => {     console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);   }); });  req.on('error', e => {   console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message); }); req.end();  setTimeout(() => {   console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus()); }, 2000); ```  ## [Benchmark](https://github.com/node-modules/agentkeepalive/tree/master/benchmark)  run the benchmark:  ```bash cd benchmark sh start.sh ```  Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     P8600  @ 2.40GHz  node@v0.8.9  50 maxSockets, 60 concurrent, 1000 requests per concurrent, 5ms delay  Keep alive agent (30 seconds):  ```js Transactions:          60000 hits Availability:         100.00 % Elapsed time:          29.70 secs Data transferred:        14.88 MB Response time:            0.03 secs Transaction rate:      2020.20 trans/sec Throughput:           0.50 MB/sec Concurrency:           59.84 Successful transactions:       60000 Failed transactions:             0 Longest transaction:          0.15 Shortest transaction:         0.01 ```  Normal agent:  ```js Transactions:          60000 hits Availability:         100.00 % Elapsed time:          46.53 secs Data transferred:        14.88 MB Response time:            0.05 secs Transaction rate:      1289.49 trans/sec Throughput:           0.32 MB/sec Concurrency:           59.81 Successful transactions:       60000 Failed transactions:             0 Longest transaction:          0.45 Shortest transaction:         0.00 ```  Socket created:  ``` [proxy.js:120000] keepalive, 50 created, 60000 requestFinished, 1200 req/socket, 0 requests, 0 sockets, 0 unusedSockets, 50 timeout {" <10ms":662," <15ms":17825," <20ms":20552," <30ms":17646," <40ms":2315," <50ms":567," <100ms":377," <150ms":56," <200ms":0," >=200ms+":0} ---------------------------------------------------------------- [proxy.js:120000] normal   , 53866 created, 84260 requestFinished, 1.56 req/socket, 0 requests, 0 sockets {" <10ms":75," <15ms":1112," <20ms":10947," <30ms":32130," <40ms":8228," <50ms":3002," <100ms":4274," <150ms":181," <200ms":18," >=200ms+":33} ```  ## License  ``` (The MIT License)  Copyright(c) node-modules and other contributors.

This option enables the following:  - Injected source maps for use in browser dev tools  [**Documentation**](https://emotion.sh/docs/source-maps)  > Note: > > Source maps are on by default in babel-plugin-emotion but they will be removed in production builds  ### `autoLabel`  `boolean`, defaults to `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.  This option enables the following:  - Automatically adds the `label` property to styles so that class names   generated by `css` or `styled` include the name of the variable the result is   assigned to. - Please note that non word characters in the variable will be removed   (Eg. `iconStyles$1` will become `iconStyles1`) because `$` is not valid   [CSS ClassName Selector](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448981/which-characters-are-valid-in-css-class-names-selectors#449000)  #### css  **In**  ```javascript const brownStyles = css({ color: 'brown' }) ```  **Out**  ```javascript const brownStyles = /*#__PURE__*/ css({ color: 'brown' }, 'label:brownStyles;') ```  `brownStyles`'s value would be `css-1q8eu9e-brownStyles`  ### `labelFormat`  `string`, defaults to `"[local]"`.  This option only works when `autoLabel` is set to `true`. It allows you to define the format of the resulting `label`. The format is defined via string where variable parts are enclosed in square brackets `[]`. For example `labelFormat: "my-classname--[local]"`, where `[local]` will be replaced with the name of the variable the result is assigned to.  Allowed values:  - `[local]` - the name of the variable the result of the `css` or `styled` expression is assigned to. - `[filename]` - name of the file (without extension) where `css` or `styled` expression is located. - `[dirname]` - name of the directory containing the file where `css` or `styled` expression is located.  This format only affects the label property of the expression, meaning that the `css` prefix and hash will be prepended automatically.  #### css  **In**  ```javascript // BrownView.js // autoLabel: true // labelFormat: [filename]--[local] const brownStyles = css({ color: 'brown' }) ```  **Out**  ```javascript const brownStyles = /*#__PURE__*/ css(   { color: 'brown' },   'label:BrownView--brownStyles;' ) ```  `BrownView--brownStyles`'s value would be `css-hash-BrownView--brownStyles`  #### styled  **In**  ```javascript const H1 = styled.h1({   borderRadius: '50%',   transition: 'transform 400ms ease-in-out',   boxSizing: 'border-box',   display: 'flex',   ':hover': {     transform: 'scale(1.2)'   } }) ```  **Out**  ```javascript const H1 = /*#__PURE__*/ styled('h1', {   label: 'H1' })({   borderRadius: '50%',   transition: 'transform 400ms ease-in-out',   boxSizing: 'border-box',   display: 'flex',   ':hover': {     transform: 'scale(1.2)'   } }) ```  `H1`'s class name attribute would be `css-hash-H1`  ### `instances`  `Array<string>`, defaults to  ```jsx ;['emotion'] ```  This option allows `babel-plugin-emotion` to know which imports to treat as emotion imports and transform as such. This option is **only** required if you use a custom instance of emotion created with `create-emotion` or you're importing emotion from somewhere other than the paths above. Relative paths are resolved relative to `process.cwd()`(the current working directory).  [**Documentation**](https://emotion.sh/docs/instances)  ### `cssPropOptimization`  `boolean`, defaults to `true`.  This option assumes that you are using something to make `@emotion/core`'s `jsx` function work for all jsx. If you are not doing so and you do not want such optimizations to occur, disable this option.  ## Babel Macros  Instead of using `babel-plugin-emotion`, you can use emotion with [`babel-plugin-macros`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros). Add `babel-plugin-macros` to your babel config (which is included in Create React App 2.0) and use the imports/packages shown below.  ```jsx import styled from 'react-emotion/macro' import { css, keyframes, injectGlobal, flush, hydrate } from 'emotion/macro' import css from '@emotion/css/macro' import styled from '@emotion/styled/macro' ```

If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 data-uri-to-buffer ================== ### Generate a Buffer instance from a [Data URI][rfc] string [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-data-uri-to-buffer)  This module accepts a ["data" URI][rfc] String of data, and returns a node.js `Buffer` instance with the decoded data.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install data-uri-to-buffer ```   Example -------  ``` js var dataUriToBuffer = require('data-uri-to-buffer');  // plain-text data is supported var uri = 'data:,Hello%2C%20World!'; var decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri); console.log(decoded.toString()); // 'Hello, World!'  // base64-encoded data is supported uri = 'data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D'; decoded = dataUriToBuffer(uri); console.log(decoded.toString()); // 'Hello, World!' ```   API ---  ### dataUriToBuffer(String uri) → Buffer  The `type` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the main type portion of the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"text/plain"` if not specified.  The `typeFull` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the entire "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI (including all parameters), or defaults to `"text/plain;charset=US-ASCII"` if not specified.  The `charset` property on the Buffer instance gets set to the Charset portion of the "mediatype" portion of the "data" URI, or defaults to `"US-ASCII"` if the entire type is not specified, or defaults to `""` otherwise.  *Note*: If the only the main type is specified but not the charset, e.g. `"data:text/plain,abc"`, the charset is set to the empty string. The spec only defaults to US-ASCII as charset if the entire type is not specified.

 degenerator =========== ### Compiles sync functions into async functions [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-degenerator/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-degenerator/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood. This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into `async` functions.  So this:  ```js function foo() {   return a('bar') || b(); } ```  Gets compiled into:  ```js async function foo() {     return await a('bar') || await b(); } ```  With the compiled output code, you can evaluate the code using the `vm` module in Node.js, or save the code to a file and require it, or whatever.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ```bash $ npm install degenerator ```   Example -------  You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be "asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did and HTTP request and returned the response body.  The user has provided us with this implementation:  ``` js function myFn() {   const one = get('https://google.com');   const two = get('http://nodejs.org');   const three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));   return [one, two, three]; } ```  Now we can compile this into an asyncronous function, implement the async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function instance with the `vm` module:   ```typescript import vm from 'vm'; import degenerator from 'degenerator';  // The `get()` function is Promise-based (error handling omitted for brevity) function get(endpoint: string) {   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {     var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');     var req = mod.get(endpoint);     req.on('response', function (res) {       var data = '';       res.setEncoding('utf8');       res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });       res.on('end', function () {         resolve(data);       });     });   }); }  // Convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var) str = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);  // Turn the JS String into a real async function instance const asyncFn = vm.runInNewContext(`(${str})`, { get });  // Now we can invoke the function asynchronously asyncFn().then((res) => {   // Do something with `res`... }); ```   API ---  ### degenerator(code: string, names: Array<string|RegExp>, options?: DegeneratorOptions): String  Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with `async`/`await` transplanted.  #### DegeneratorOptions  An options object _may_ be passed in as the third parameter, with the following values:   * `output` - string - May be `"async"` or `"generator"`, defaults to `"async"`.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner.

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

=========================================

 # expo-random  Provides a native interface for creating strong random bytes. With `Random` you can generate random values to address use cases that other APIs like the web's `crypto.getRandomValues` and Node's `crypto.randomBytes` might address.  # Installation in managed Expo projects  For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/random/).  You can add a polyfill for the web's `crypto.getRandomValues` by installing [expo-standard-web-crypto](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-standard-web-crypto) and importing it in SDK 39 and higher:  ```js import { polyfillWebCrypto } from 'expo-standard-web-crypto';  polyfillWebCrypto(); // crypto.getRandomValues is now globally defined ```  Other libraries like [react-native-get-random-values](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values) may work too.  # Installation in bare React Native projects  For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.  ### Add the package to your npm dependencies  ``` expo install expo-random ```  ### Configure for iOS  Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package.  ### Configure for Android  No additional set up necessary.

 get-uri ======= ### Returns a `stream.Readable` from a URI string [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-get-uri/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-get-uri/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This high-level module accepts a URI string and returns a `Readable` stream instance. There is built-in support for a variety of "protocols", and it's easily extensible with more:  | Protocol  | Description                     | Example |:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------------: | `data`    | [Data URIs][data]               | `data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D` | `file`    | [File URIs][file]               | `file:///c:/windows/example.ini` | `ftp`     | [FTP URIs][ftp]                 | `ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/site/README` | `http`    | [HTTP URIs][http]               | `http://www.example.com/path/to/name` | `https`   | [HTTPS URIs][https]             | `https://www.example.com/path/to/name`   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install get-uri ```   Example -------  To simply get a `stream.Readable` instance from a `file:` URI, try something like:  ``` js var getUri = require('get-uri');  // `file:` maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance… getUri('file:///Users/nrajlich/wat.json', function (err, rs) {   if (err) throw err;   rs.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```   Missing Endpoints -----------------  When you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the destination server, then a `NotFoundError` will be returned. The `code` of the error instance is set to `"ENOTFOUND"`, so you can special-case that in your code to detect when a bad filename is requested:  ``` js getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {   if (err) {     if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {       // bad file path requested     } else {       // something else bad happened...       throw err;     }   }    // your app code… }); ```   Cacheability ------------  When calling `getUri()` with the same URI multiple times, the `get-uri` module supports sending an indicator that the remote resource has not been modified since the last time it has been retreived from that node process.  To do this, pass in a `cache` option to the "options object" argument with the value set to the `stream.Readable` instance that was previously returned. If the remote resource has not been changed since the last call for that same URI, then a `NotModifiedError` instance will be returned with it's `code` property set to `"ENOTMODIFIED"`.  When the `"ENOTMODIFIED"` error occurs, then you can safely re-use the results from the previous `getUri()` call for that same URI:  ``` js // maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {   if (err) throw err;    // … some time later, if you need to get this same URI again, pass in the   // previous `stream.Readable` instance as `cache` option to potentially   // receive an "ENOTMODIFIED" response:   var opts = { cache: rs };   getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', opts, function (err, rs2) {     if (err) {       if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {         // bad file path requested       } else if ('ENOTMODIFIED' == err.code) {         // source file has not been modified since last time it was requested,         // so `rs2` is undefined and you are expected to re-use results from         // a previous call to `getUri()`       } else {         // something else bad happened...         throw err;       }     }   }); }); ```   API ---  ### getUri(String uri[, Object options,] Function callback)  A `uri` String is required. An optional `options` object may be passed in:   - `cache` - A `stream.Readable` instance from a previous call to `getUri()` with the same URI. If this option is passed in, and the destination endpoint has not been modified, then an `ENOTMODIFIED` error is returned  Any other options passed in to the `options` object will be passed through to the low-level connection creation functions (`http.get()`, `ftp.connect()`, etc).

 https-proxy-agent ================ ### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.  Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy" server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.  Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets). See the "Examples" section below for more.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install https-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### `https` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var options = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy); options.agent = agent;  https.get(options, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var WebSocket = require('ws'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint); console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var options = url.parse(proxy);  var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);  // finally, initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () {   console.log('"open" event!');   socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {   console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);   socket.close(); }); ```  API ---  ### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)  The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].  The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an "options" object with more specific properties:    * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.   * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.   * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.   * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.   * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.  ## Table Of Main Contents  - [Usage](#usage) - [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x) - [Contributing](#contributing) - Related Packages   - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.  ## Usage  ```js const ignore = require('ignore') const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/']) ```  ### Filter the given paths  ```js const paths = [   '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out   '.abc/d/e.js'   // included ]  ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true ```  ### As the filter function  ```js paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js'] ```  ### Win32 paths will be handled  ```js ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js']) // if the code above runs on windows, the result will be // ['.abc\\d\\e.js'] ```  ## Why another ignore?  - `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.  - `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so   - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.   - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.  - Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:   - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.   - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.   - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.   - Handle trailing whitespaces:     - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).     - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`   - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.  ## Methods  ### .add(pattern) ### .add(patterns)  - **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance - **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.  Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.  Returns `this`  Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.  ```js ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true ```  `pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:  ```js ignore() .add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString()) .filter(filenames) ```  `pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.  ### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>  REMOVED in `3.x` for now.  To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use  ```js const fs = require('fs')  if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {   ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString()) } ```  instead.   ### .ignores(pathname)  > new in 3.2.0  Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.  ```js ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true ```  ### .filter(paths)  Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.  - **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.  **NOTICE** that:  - `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.  ```js // WRONG ig.ignores('./abc')  // WRONG, for it will never happen. // If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory, // `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`. // ``` // path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc' // ``` ig.ignores('/abc')  // Right ig.ignores('abc')  // Right ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc' ```  - In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.  Suppose the dir structure is:  ``` /path/to/your/repo     |-- a     |   |-- a.js     |     |-- .b     |     |-- .c          |-- .DS_store ```  Then the `paths` might be like this:  ```js [   'a/a.js'   '.b',   '.c/.DS_store' ] ```  Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:  ```js const glob = require('glob')  glob('**', {   // Adds a / character to directory matches.   mark: true }, (err, files) => {   if (err) {     return console.error(err)   }    let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)   console.log(filtered) }) ```  ### .createFilter()  Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.  Returns `function(path)` the filter function.  ****  ## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x  - All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them. - `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed. - `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.  ****  ## Contributing  The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.  So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.  #### Collaborators  - [SamyPesse](https://github.com/SamyPesse) *Samy Pessé* - [azproduction](https://github.com/azproduction) *Mikhail Davydov* - [TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) *Bogdan Chadkin* - [JanMattner](https://github.com/JanMattner) *Jan Mattner*

=========================================

 iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

 # Least Recently Used (LRU) cache algorithm  A finite key-value map using the [Least Recently Used (LRU)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) algorithm, where the most recently-used items are "kept alive" while older, less-recently used items are evicted to make room for newer items.  Useful when you want to limit use of memory to only hold commonly-used things.  [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/rsms/js-lru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rsms/js-lru)  ## Terminology & design  - Based on a doubly-linked list for low complexity random shuffling of entries.  - The cache object iself has a "head" (least recently used entry) and a   "tail" (most recently used entry).  - The "oldest" and "newest" are list entries -- an entry might have a "newer" and   an "older" entry (doubly-linked, "older" being close to "head" and "newer"   being closer to "tail").  - Key lookup is done through a key-entry mapping native object, which on most    platforms mean `O(1)` complexity. This comes at a very low memory cost  (for    storing two extra pointers for each entry).  Fancy ASCII art illustration of the general design:  ```txt            entry             entry             entry             entry                    ______            ______            ______            ______                  | head |.newer => |      |.newer => |      |.newer => | tail |       .oldest = |  A   |          |  B   |          |  C   |          |  D   | = .newest           |______| <= older.|______| <= older.|______| <= older.|______|                                                                                            removed  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  <--  added ```  ## Example  ```js let c = new LRUMap(3) c.set('adam',   29) c.set('john',   26) c.set('angela', 24) c.toString()        // -> "adam:29 < john:26 < angela:24" c.get('john')       // -> 26  // Now 'john' is the most recently used entry, since we just requested it c.toString()        // -> "adam:29 < angela:24 < john:26" c.set('zorro', 141) // -> {key:adam, value:29}  // Because we only have room for 3 entries, adding 'zorro' caused 'adam' // to be removed in order to make room for the new entry c.toString()        // -> "angela:24 < john:26 < zorro:141" ```  # Usage  **Recommended:** Copy the code in lru.js or copy the lru.js and lru.d.ts files into your source directory. For minimal functionality, you only need the lines up until the comment that says "Following code is optional".  **Using NPM:** [`yarn add lru_map`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru_map) (note that because NPM is one large flat namespace, you need to import the module as "lru_map" rather than simply "lru".)  **Using AMD:** An [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md#amd) module loader like [`amdld`](https://github.com/rsms/js-amdld) can be used to load this module as well. There should be nothing to configure.  **Testing**:  - Run tests with `npm test` - Run benchmarks with `npm run benchmark`  **ES compatibility:** This implementation is compatible with modern JavaScript environments and depend on the following features not found in ES5:  - `const` and `let` keywords - `Symbol` including `Symbol.iterator` - `Map`  > Note: If you need ES5 compatibility e.g. to use with older browsers, [please use version 2](https://github.com/rsms/js-lru/tree/v2) which has a slightly less feature-full API but is well-tested and about as fast as this implementation.  **Using with TypeScript**  This module comes with complete typing coverage for use with TypeScript. If you copied the code or files rather than using a module loader, make sure to include `lru.d.ts` into the same location where you put `lru.js`.  ```ts import {LRUMap} from './lru' // import {LRUMap} from 'lru'     // when using via AMD // import {LRUMap} from 'lru_map' // when using from NPM console.log('LRUMap:', LRUMap) ```  # API  The API imitates that of [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), which means that in most cases you can use `LRUMap` as a drop-in replacement for `Map`.  ```ts export class LRUMap<K,V> {   // Construct a new cache object which will hold up to limit entries.   // When the size == limit, a `put` operation will evict the oldest entry.   //   // If `entries` is provided, all entries are added to the new map.   // `entries` should be an Array or other iterable object whose elements are   // key-value pairs (2-element Arrays). Each key-value pair is added to the new Map.   // null is treated as undefined.   constructor(limit :number, entries? :Iterable<[K,V]>);    // Convenience constructor equivalent to `new LRUMap(count(entries), entries)`   constructor(entries :Iterable<[K,V]>);    // Current number of items   size :number;    // Maximum number of items this map can hold   limit :number;    // Least recently-used entry. Invalidated when map is modified.   oldest :Entry<K,V>;    // Most recently-used entry. Invalidated when map is modified.   newest :Entry<K,V>;    // Replace all values in this map with key-value pairs (2-element Arrays) from   // provided iterable.   assign(entries :Iterable<[K,V]>) : void;    // Put <value> into the cache associated with <key>. Replaces any existing entry   // with the same key. Returns `this`.   set(key :K, value :V) : LRUMap<K,V>;    // Purge the least recently used (oldest) entry from the cache.   // Returns the removed entry or undefined if the cache was empty.   shift() : [K,V] | undefined;    // Get and register recent use of <key>.   // Returns the value associated with <key> or undefined if not in cache.   get(key :K) : V | undefined;    // Check if there's a value for key in the cache without registering recent use.   has(key :K) : boolean;    // Access value for <key> without registering recent use. Useful if you do not   // want to chage the state of the map, but only "peek" at it.   // Returns the value associated with <key> if found, or undefined if not found.   find(key :K) : V | undefined;    // Remove entry <key> from cache and return its value.   // Returns the removed value, or undefined if not found.   delete(key :K) : V | undefined;    // Removes all entries   clear() : void;    // Returns an iterator over all keys, starting with the oldest.   keys() : Iterator<K>;    // Returns an iterator over all values, starting with the oldest.   values() : Iterator<V>;    // Returns an iterator over all entries, starting with the oldest.   entries() : Iterator<[K,V]>;    // Returns an iterator over all entries, starting with the oldest.   [Symbol.iterator]() : Iterator<[K,V]>;    // Call `fun` for each entry, starting with the oldest entry.   forEach(fun :(value :V, key :K, m :LRUMap<K,V>)=>void, thisArg? :any) : void;    // Returns an object suitable for JSON encoding   toJSON() : Array<{key :K, value :V}>;    // Returns a human-readable text representation   toString() : string; }  // An entry holds the key and value, and pointers to any older and newer entries. // Entries might hold references to adjacent entries in the internal linked-list. // Therefore you should never store or modify Entry objects. Instead, reference the // key and value of an entry when needed. interface Entry<K,V> {   key   :K;   value :V; } ```  If you need to perform any form of finalization of items as they are evicted from the cache, wrapping the `shift` method is a good way to do it:  ```js let c = new LRUMap(123); c.shift = function() {   let entry = LRUMap.prototype.shift.call(this);   doSomethingWith(entry);   return entry; } ```  The internals calls `shift` as entries need to be evicted, so this method is guaranteed to be called for any item that's removed from the cache. The returned entry must not include any strong references to other entries. See note in the documentation of `LRUMap.prototype.set()`.   # MIT license  Copyright (c) 2010-2016 Rasmus Andersson <https://rsms.me/>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

%% netmask@2.0.2 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE:
=========================================

 Netmask =======  The Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.  Synopsis --------  ```js var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask  var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12'); block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0 block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0 block.bitmask;                  // 12 block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255 block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255 block.size;                     // 1048576 block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1 block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254  block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false  block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));  block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12') ```  Constructing ------------  Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:  ``` '216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form. '216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0' '216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0' '216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00 '216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block. '0330.0360.040.04'              // Octal form '0xd8.0xf0.0x20.0x4'            // Hex form ```  API ---  - `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block. - `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0). - `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255). - `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24). - `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256). - `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255) - `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address - `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network. - `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`. - `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block. Undef will be returned if out of legal address space. - `.toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')  Installation ------------      $ npm install netmask  Run all tests (vows plus mocha) -------------------------------      $ npm test  License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011 Olivier Poitrey <rs@rhapsodyk.net>  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

 pac-proxy-agent =============== ### A [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that retreives the specified [PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia] and uses it to resolve which HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy, or if a direct connection should be used to connect to the HTTP endpoint.  It is designed to be be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install pac-proxy-agent ```   Example -------  ``` js var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var PacProxyAgent = require('pac-proxy-agent');  // URI to a PAC proxy file to use (the "pac+" prefix is stripped) var proxy = 'pac+https://cloudup.com/ceGH2yZ0Bjp+'; console.log('using PAC proxy proxy file at %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `PacProxyAgent` class with the PAC file location var agent = new PacProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  http.get(opts, function (res) {   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```   License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2014 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

 pac-resolver ============ ### Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia] [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/actions?workflow=Node+CI)   This module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a [PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ```bash $ npm install pac-resolver ```   Example -------  Given the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:  ```js function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {   if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), "10.1.10.0", "255.255.255.0")) {     return "PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080";   } else {     return "DIRECT";   } } ```  You can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:  ```js var fs = require('fs'); var pac = require('pac-resolver');  var FindProxyForURL = pac(fs.readFileSync('proxy.pac'));  FindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/').then((res) => {   console.log(res);   // "DIRECT" }); ```   API ---  ### pac(String pacFileContents[, Object options]) → Function  Returns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS string `pacFileContents` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be passed in which respects the following options:   * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.  * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the  JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to  include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For  async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function  instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were  synchronous.

 proxy-agent =========== ### Maps proxy protocols to `http.Agent` implementations [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent)  This module provides a function that returns proxying `http.Agent` instances to use based off of a given proxy URI. If no URI is provided, then [proxy-from-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env) is used to get the URI from `$HTTP_PROXY`, `$HTTPS_PROXY` and `$NO_PROXY` among others.  An LRU cache is used so that `http.Agent` instances are transparently re-used for subsequent HTTP requests to the same proxy server.  The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:   | Protocol   | Proxy Agent for `http` requests | Proxy Agent for `https` requests | Example |:----------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:--------: | `http`     | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128` | `https`    | [http-proxy-agent][]            | [https-proxy-agent][]            | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129` | `socks(v5)`| [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional) | `socks5`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks5://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional) | `socks4`   | [socks-proxy-agent][]           | [socks-proxy-agent][]            | `socks4://some-socks-proxy.com:9050` | `pac`      | [pac-proxy-agent][]             | [pac-proxy-agent][]              | `pac+http://www.example.com/proxy.pac`   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install proxy-agent ```   Example -------  ``` js var http = require('http'); var ProxyAgent = require('proxy-agent');  // HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use var proxyUri = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';  var opts = {   method: 'GET',   host: 'jsonip.org',   path: '/',   // this is the important part!   // If no proxyUri is specified, then https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-from-env   // is used to get the proxyUri.   agent: new ProxyAgent(proxyUri) };  // the rest works just like any other normal HTTP request http.get(opts, onresponse);  function onresponse (res) {   console.log(res.statusCode, res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); } ```   API ---  ### new ProxyAgent(Object|String opts|uri)  Returns an `http.Agent` instance based off of the given proxy `opts` or URI string. An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance will be returned if identical args are passed in.

For the purposes of this definition,       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,       and conversions to other media types.        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"       replaced with your own identifying information.

 [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-select.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/JedWatson/react-select/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/JedWatson/react-select/tree/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/JedWatson/react-select/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/JedWatson/react-select?branch=master) [![Supported by Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart.svg)](http://thinkmill.com.au/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=react-select)  # React-Select  The Select control for [React](https://reactjs.com). Initially built for use in [KeystoneJS](http://www.keystonejs.com).  See [react-select.com](https://www.react-select.com) for live demos and comprehensive docs.  See our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3585) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v2 to v3.  React Select is funded by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au) and [Atlassian](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com). It represents a whole new approach to developing powerful React.js components that _just work_ out of the box, while being extremely customisable.  Features include:  - Flexible approach to data, with customisable functions - Extensible styling API with [emotion](https://emotion.sh) - Component Injection API for complete control over the UI behaviour - Controllable state props and modular architecture - Long-requested features like option groups, portal support, animation, and more  If you're interested in the background, watch Jed's [talk on React Select](https://youtu.be/Eb2wy-HNGMo) at ReactNYC in March 2018.  See our [upgrade guide](https://react-select.com/upgrade-guide) for a breakdown on how to upgrade from v1 to v2.  The old docs and examples will continue to be available at [v1.react-select.com](https://v1.react-select.com).  # Installation and usage  The easiest way to use react-select is to install it from npm and build it into your app with Webpack.  ``` yarn add react-select ```  Then use it in your app:  ```js import React from 'react'; import Select from 'react-select';  const options = [   { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },   { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },   { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' }, ];  class App extends React.Component {   state = {     selectedOption: null,   };   handleChange = selectedOption => {     this.setState({ selectedOption });     console.log(`Option selected:`, selectedOption);   };   render() {     const { selectedOption } = this.state;      return (       <Select         value={selectedOption}         onChange={this.handleChange}         options={options}       />     );   } } ```  ## Props  Common props you may want to specify include:  - `autoFocus` - focus the control when it mounts - `className` - apply a className to the control - `classNamePrefix` - apply classNames to inner elements with the given prefix - `isDisabled` - disable the control - `isMulti` - allow the user to select multiple values - `isSearchable` - allow the user to search for matching options - `name` - generate an HTML input with this name, containing the current value - `onChange` - subscribe to change events - `options` - specify the options the user can select from - `placeholder` - change the text displayed when no option is selected - `value` - control the current value  See the [props documentation](https://www.react-select.com/props) for complete documentation on the props react-select supports.  ## Controllable Props  You can control the following props by providing values for them. If you don't, react-select will manage them for you.  - `value` / `onChange` - specify the current value of the control - `menuIsOpen` / `onMenuOpen` / `onMenuClose` - control whether the menu is open - `inputValue` / `onInputChange` - control the value of the search input (changing this will update the available options)  If you don't provide these props, you can set the initial value of the state they control:  - `defaultValue` - set the initial value of the control - `defaultMenuIsOpen` - set the initial open value of the menu - `defaultInputValue` - set the initial value of the search input  ## Methods  React-select exposes two public methods:  - `focus()` - focus the control programatically - `blur()` - blur the control programatically  ## Customisation  Check the docs for more information on:  - [Customising the styles](https://www.react-select.com/styles) - [Using custom components](https://www.react-select.com/components) - [Using the built-in animated components](https://www.react-select.com/home#animated-components) - [Creating an async select](https://www.react-select.com/async) - [Allowing users to create new options](https://www.react-select.com/creatable) - [Advanced use-cases](https://www.react-select.com/advanced)  # Thanks  Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this project.

 redux-batched-subscribe =====================  [![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/tappleby/redux-batched-subscribe/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/tappleby/redux-batched-subscribe) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux-batched-subscribe.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-batched-subscribe)  Store enhancer for [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) which allows batching of subscribe notifications that occur as a result of dispatches.  ```js npm install --save redux-batched-subscribe ```  ## Usage  The `batchedSubscribe` store enhancer accepts a function which is called after every dispatch with a `notify` callback as a single argument. Calling the `notify` callback will trigger all the subscription handlers, this gives you the ability to use various techniques to delay subscription notifications such as: debouncing, React batched updates or requestAnimationFrame.  Since `batchedSubscribe` overloads the dispatch and subscribe handlers on the original redux store it is important that it gets applied before any other store enhancers or middleware that depend on these functions; The [compose](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/master/docs/api/compose.md) utility in redux can be used to handle this:  ```js import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux'; import { batchedSubscribe } from 'redux-batched-subscribe';  const enhancer = compose(   applyMiddleware(...middleware),   batchedSubscribe((notify) => {     notify();   }) )  // Note: passing enhancer as the last argument to createStore requires redux@>=3.1.0 const store = createStore(reducer, initialState, enhancer); ```  *Note: since `compose` applies functions from right to left, `batchedSubscribe` should appear at the end of the chain.*  The store enhancer also exposes a `subscribeImmediate` method which allows for unbatched subscribe notifications.  ## Examples  ### Debounced subscribe handlers:  ```js import { createStore } from 'redux'; import { batchedSubscribe } from 'redux-batched-subscribe'; import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';  const batchDebounce = debounce(notify => notify()); const finalCreateStore = batchedSubscribe(batchDebounce)(createStore); const store = finalCreateStore(reducer, intialState); ```  ### React batched updates  ```js import { createStore } from 'redux'; import { batchedSubscribe } from 'redux-batched-subscribe';  // React <= 0.13 import { addons } from 'react/addons'; const batchedUpdates = addons.batchedUpdates;  // React 0.14 import { unstable_batchedUpdates as batchedUpdates } from 'react-dom';  // Note: passing batchedSubscribe as the last argument to createStore requires redux@>=3.1.0 const store = createStore(reducer, intialState, batchedSubscribe(batchedUpdates)); ```  ## Thanks  Thanks to [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite) for the clean library structure.

=========================================

 socks-proxy-agent ================ ### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.  It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.  Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install socks-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### TypeScript example  ```ts import https from 'https'; import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';  const info = { 	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com', 	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com', 	password: 'abcdef12345124' }; const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);  https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => { 	console.log(res.headers); 	res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `http` module example  ```js var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  http.get(opts, function (res) { 	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers); 	res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `https` module example  ```js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  https.get(opts, function (res) { 	console.log('"response" event!', res.headers); 	res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var WebSocket = require('ws'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);  // initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () { 	console.log('"open" event!'); 	socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) { 	console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags); 	socket.close(); }); ```  License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

It is published under the > `@alpha` tag on npm and contains new features and changes for the next major version.  Utilising [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals) (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the [power of CSS](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#supported-css), `styled-components` allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!  `styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.  _Supported by [Front End Center](https://frontend.center). Thank you for making this possible!_  ## Upgrading from v4  1. `npm install styled-components@alpha react@^16.8 react-dom@^16.8 react-is@^16.8` 1. ?? 1. Profit!  > Note that integrations like `jest-styled-components` that make use of internals will need to be updated to work with v5 and likely will not work properly during the alpha/beta period.  ## [Docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)  **See the documentation at [styled-components.com/docs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)** for more information about using `styled-components`!  Quicklinks to some of the most-visited pages:  - [**Getting started**](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics) - [API Reference](https://styled-components.com/docs/api) - [Theming](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) - [Server-side rendering](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering) - [Tagged Template Literals explained](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)  ## Example  <!-- prettier-ignore --> ```JSX import React from 'react';  import styled from 'styled-components';  // Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is // centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em const Title = styled.h1`   font-size: 1.5em;   text-align: center;   color: palevioletred; `;  // Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with // some padding and a papayawhip background const Wrapper = styled.section`   padding: 4em;   background: papayawhip; `;  // Use them like any other React component – except they're styled! <Wrapper>   <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title> </Wrapper> ```  This is what you'll see in your browser:  <div align="center">   <a href="https://styled-components.com">     <img alt="Screenshot of the above code ran in a browser" src="http://i.imgur.com/wUJpcjY.jpg" />   </a> </div>  ## Babel Macro  If you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the `styled-components/macro` import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.  ```js import styled from 'styled-components/macro';  // A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR) const Title = styled.h1`   font-size: 1.5em;   text-align: center;   color: palevioletred; `; ```  If you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a `.babelrc`, [see this guide](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/author.md#config-experimental). The config name is `"styledComponents"`.  ## Built with `styled-components`  A lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides. A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project! There’s also a whole lot of interesting apps and sites that people have built using styled-components.  Make sure to head over to [awesome-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components) to see them all! And please contribute and add your own work to the list so others can find it.  ## Contributing  If you want to contribute to `styled-components` please see our [contributing and community guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md), they'll help you get set up locally and explain the whole process.

Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install superagent-proxy ```   Example -------  ``` js var request = require('superagent');  // extend with Request#proxy() require('superagent-proxy')(request);  // HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy to use var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.43.102:3128';  request   .get(process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/')   .proxy(proxy)   .end(onresponse);  function onresponse (err, res) {   if (err) {     console.log(err);   } else {     console.log(res.status, res.headers);     console.log(res.body);   } } ```   License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:  You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and  If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

%% xregexp@2.0.0 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE:
=========================================

 [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) ==============================  XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.  XRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.   ## Performance  XRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.   ## Usage examples  ~~~ js // Using named capture and flag x (free-spacing and line comments) var date = XRegExp('(?<year>  [0-9]{4}) -?  # year  \n\                     (?<month> [0-9]{2}) -?  # month \n\                     (?<day>   [0-9]{2})     # day   ', 'x');  // XRegExp.exec gives you named backreferences on the match result var match = XRegExp.exec('2012-02-22', date); match.day; // -> '22'  // It also includes optional pos and sticky arguments var pos = 3, result = []; while (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\d+)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {     result.push(match[1]);     pos = match.index + match[0].length; } // result -> ['2', '3', '4']  // XRegExp.replace allows named backreferences in replacements XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012' XRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {     return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year; }); // -> '02/22/2012'  // In fact, all XRegExps are RegExps and work perfectly with native methods date.test('2012-02-22'); // -> true  // The *only* caveat is that named captures must be referred to using numbered backreferences '2012-02-22'.replace(date, '$2/$3/$1'); // -> '02/22/2012'  // If you want, you can extend native methods so you don't have to worry about this // Doing so also fixes numerous browser bugs in the native methods XRegExp.install('natives'); '2012-02-22'.replace(date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012' '2012-02-22'.replace(date, function (match) {     return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year; }); // -> '02/22/2012' date.exec('2012-02-22').day; // -> '22'  // Extract every other digit from a string using XRegExp.forEach XRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\d/, function (match, i) {     if (i % 2) this.push(+match[0]); }, []); // -> [2, 4]  // Get numbers within <b> tags using XRegExp.matchChain XRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [     XRegExp('(?is)<b>.*?</b>'),     /\d+/ ]); // -> ['2', '4', '56']  // You can also pass forward and return specific backreferences var html = '<a href="http://xregexp.com/">XRegExp</a>\             <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'; XRegExp.matchChain(html, [     {regex: /<a href="([^"]+)">/i, backref: 1},     {regex: XRegExp('(?i)^https?://(?<domain>[^/?#]+)'), backref: 'domain'} ]); // -> ['xregexp.com', 'www.google.com']  // XRegExp.union safely merges strings and regexes into a single pattern XRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\1/, /(cats)\1/], 'i'); // -> /a\+b\*c|(dogs)\1|(cats)\2/i ~~~  These examples should give you the flavor of what's possible, but XRegExp has more syntax, flags, utils, options, and browser fixes that aren't shown here. You can even augment XRegExp's regular expression syntax with addons (see below) or write your own. See [xregexp.com](http://xregexp.com/) for more details.   ## Addons  In browsers, you can either load addons individually, or bundle all addons together with XRegExp by loading `xregexp-all.js`. XRegExp's [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package uses `xregexp-all.js`, which means that the addons are always available when XRegExp is installed on the server using npm.   ### XRegExp Unicode Base  In browsers, first include the Unicode Base script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/unicode/unicode-base.js"></script> ~~~  Then you can do this:  ~~~ js var unicodeWord = XRegExp('^\\p{L}+$'); unicodeWord.test('Русский'); // -> true unicodeWord.test('日本語'); // -> true unicodeWord.test('العربية'); // -> true ~~~  The base script adds `\p{Letter}` and its alias `\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:  ~~~ js XRegExp('^\\p{Hiragana}+$').test('ひらがな'); // -> true XRegExp('^[\\p{Latin}\\p{Common}]+$').test('Über Café.'); // -> true ~~~  XRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.   ### XRegExp.build  In browsers, first include the script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/build.js"></script> ~~~  You can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:  ~~~ js var time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {     hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {         h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,         h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/     }, 'x'),     minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/ });  time.test('10:59'); // -> true XRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59' ~~~  Named subpatterns can be provided as strings or regex objects. A leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns if both are present, which allows embedding independently useful anchored patterns. `{{…}}` tokens can be quantified as a single unit. Backreferences in the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly within the larger combined pattern. The syntax `({{name}})` works as shorthand for named capture via `(?<name>{{name}})`. Named subpatterns cannot be embedded within character classes.  See also: *[Creating Grammatical Regexes Using XRegExp.build](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/grammatical-patterns-xregexp-build)*.   ### XRegExp.matchRecursive  In browsers, first include the script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/matchrecursive.js"></script> ~~~  You can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:  ~~~ js var str = '(t((e))s)t()(ing)'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\(', '\\)', 'g'); // -> ['t((e))s', '', 'ing']  // Extended information mode with valueNames str = 'Here is <div> <div>an</div></div> example'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<div\\s*>', '</div>', 'gi', {     valueNames: ['between', 'left', 'match', 'right'] }); /* -> [ {name: 'between', value: 'Here is ',       start: 0,  end: 8}, {name: 'left',    value: '<div>',          start: 8,  end: 13}, {name: 'match',   value: ' <div>an</div>', start: 13, end: 27}, {name: 'right',   value: '</div>',         start: 27, end: 33}, {name: 'between', value: ' example',       start: 33, end: 41} ] */  // Omitting unneeded parts with null valueNames, and using escapeChar str = '...{1}\\{{function(x,y){return y+x;}}'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '{', '}', 'g', {     valueNames: ['literal', null, 'value', null],     escapeChar: '\\' }); /* -> [ {name: 'literal', value: '...', start: 0, end: 3}, {name: 'value',   value: '1',   start: 4, end: 5}, {name: 'literal', value: '\\{', start: 6, end: 8}, {name: 'value',   value: 'function(x,y){return y+x;}', start: 9, end: 35} ] */  // Sticky mode via flag y str = '<1><<<2>>><3>4<5>'; XRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<', '>', 'gy'); // -> ['1', '<<2>>', '3'] ~~~  `XRegExp.matchRecursive` throws an error if it sees an unbalanced delimiter in the target string.   ### XRegExp Prototype Methods  In browsers, first include the script:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp.js"></script> <script src="addons/prototypes.js"></script> ~~~  New XRegExp regexes then gain a collection of useful methods: `apply`, `call`, `forEach`, `globalize`, `xexec`, and `xtest`.  ~~~ js // To demonstrate the call method, let's first create the function we'll be using... function filter(array, fn) {     var res = [];     array.forEach(function (el) {if (fn.call(null, el)) res.push(el);});     return res; } // Now we can filter arrays using functions and regexes filter(['a', 'ba', 'ab', 'b'], XRegExp('^a')); // -> ['a', 'ab'] ~~~  Native `RegExp` objects copied by `XRegExp` are augmented with any `XRegExp.prototype` methods. The following lines therefore work equivalently:  ~~~ js XRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc'); XRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc'); XRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc'); ~~~   ## Installation and usage  In browsers:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp-min.js"></script> ~~~  Or, to bundle XRegExp with all of its addons:  ~~~ html <script src="xregexp-all-min.js"></script> ~~~  Using [npm](http://npmjs.org/):  ~~~ bash npm install xregexp ~~~  In [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CommonJS module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules) loaders:  ~~~ js var XRegExp = require('xregexp').XRegExp; ~~~   ### Running tests on the server with npm  ~~~ bash npm install -g qunit  # needed to run the tests npm test  # in the xregexp root ~~~  If XRegExp was not installed using npm, just open `tests/index.html` in your browser.   ## &c  **Lookbehind:** A [collection of short functions](https://gist.github.com/2387872) is available that makes it easy to simulate infinite-length leading lookbehind.   ## Changelog  * Releases: [Version history](http://xregexp.com/history/). * Upcoming: [Milestones](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/issues/milestones), [Roadmap](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/wiki/Roadmap).   ## About  XRegExp and addons copyright 2007-2012 by [Steven Levithan](http://stevenlevithan.com/).  Tools: Unicode range generators by [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/). Source file concatenator by [Bjarke Walling](http://twitter.com/walling).  Prior art: `XRegExp.build` inspired by [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/)'s [RegExp.create](http://lea.verou.me/2011/03/create-complex-regexps-more-easily/). `XRegExp.union` inspired by [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
