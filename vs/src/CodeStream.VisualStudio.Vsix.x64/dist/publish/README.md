# New Relic CodeStream

Shift left by making code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process. 

- See how the services built from your code are performing, with information about golden metrics, errors, transaction anomalies, SLOs, and more.
- Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.
- See performance data for individual methods in the code, right in the editor.

### Requirements

- This version of CodeStream requires Visual Studio 2022, version 17.6 or later. CodeStream is also available for [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream) or [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream).
- Your repository must be managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub.
- For Windows users, CodeStream now requires a 64-bit version of the OS.

# Code-Level Metrics

See performance data, at the method level, right in your editor. Always-on view ensures that performance issues are factored into the work at hand. You can even see metrics for your lower environments, and head off performance issues before they hit production.

# Error Investigation

Discover errors happening in the code youâ€™re responsible for. Quickly step through the stack trace, with CodeStream automatically taking you to the correct file and line number, then bring relevant teammates into the discussion so that you can resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
