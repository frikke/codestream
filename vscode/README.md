# New Relic CodeStream

Shift left by making code performance part of the earliest stages of the development process. 

- See how the services built from your code are performing, with information about golden metrics, errors, transaction anomalies, SLOs, and more.
- Investigate errors more quickly by stepping through the stack trace and collaborating with teammates.
- Search logs from your IDE to investigate issues without context switching.
- Run NRQL queries, and save and share queries with your teammates via .nrql files.
- See performance data for individual methods in the code, right in the editor.

### Requirements

- CodeStream requires a current version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and is also available for [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12206-codestream) or [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream-vs-22).
- Your repository must be managed by Git, or a Git hosting service like GitHub or GitLab.

# Code-Level Metrics

See performance data, at the method level, right in your editor. Always-on view ensures that performance issues are factored into the work at hand. You can even see metrics for your lower environments, and head off performance issues before they hit production.

# Log Search

No need to slow down your investigation by context switching between your IDE and your browser to search logs. CodeStream brings the New Relic log-search experience right into your IDE! You can even search for output from specific log lines in your code.

# Error Investigation

Discover errors happening in the code youâ€™re responsible for. Quickly step through the stack trace, with CodeStream automatically taking you to the correct file and line number, then bring relevant teammates into the discussion so that you can resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

# Performance Monitoring

Get an in-IDE view of how the services built from your code are performing, in any environment. Golden metrics, service-level objectives and related services give you the big picture at a glance.
